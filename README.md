**Project Description** 
=======================
"Gsortingr" is a mobile app developed by Pace University students for CS 691 and CS 692 projects. The app aims to help users identify different types of household waste and suggest appropriate ways to dispose of it.

The application has two search methods: text search and photo scan search. Users can either enter keywords related to the waste they want to identify or scan a picture of the waste using their phone's camera. The application then analyzes the image and gets a breakdown of the garbage being queried.

"Gsortingr"  is a useful tool for those who wish to raise environmental awareness by properly disposing of waste. The application's simple interface and user-friendly design enable users to quickly identify and dispose of household waste in a responsible and sustainable manner."
